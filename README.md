# Stock Prediction using Elastisearch on r/wallstreetbets
> This project uses Elastisearch on posts from the wallstreetbets. We aim to search text in individual posts, and use a variety of metrics, such as sentiment analysis, to correlate text to desirable or undersirable stocks. This information will be used to guide a user to invest in certain stocks.

## Technologies
We'll be collecting text data from r/wallstreetsbets using Elastisearch, and saving the sentiment of the text in conjunction with the stock in question. We will draw inferences in this way as part of a stock investment strategy.
